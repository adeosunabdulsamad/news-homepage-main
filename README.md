### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<article>
   <div class="img"><img src="./assets/images/image-retro-pcs.jpg" alt="retro pcs"></div>
  <div class="line"><h2>01</h2>
  <h3><a href=#>Reviving Retro PCs</a></h3>
  What happens when old PCs are given modern upgrades?
   </div></article>
```
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter&display=swap');
*{
    font-family: 'Inter';
    box-sizing: border-box;
 }
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I need to build up on my responsive web design and css properties

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me a lot when i was stuck. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand positioning in css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
